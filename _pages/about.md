My passion lies at the intersection of data and security. As a graduate student at George Mason University pursuing Data Analytics, I'm fueled by the potential to unlock insights and drive innovation. My journey began at DRDO India, where I honed my skills in post-quantum cryptography, delving into the world of securing communication for the future.

My expertise lies in wielding data analysis tools like Python, R, and SQL. I also possess a solid understanding of cybersecurity principles, particularly cryptography and network security. Whether it's crafting compelling data visualizations with Tableau or Power BI, I take pride in translating complex data into digestible and actionable insights.

One of my most impactful projects at DRDO involved developing a post-quantum cryptographic algorithm. This solution boasts an impressive  efficiency improvement, offering robust protection against future threats and safeguarding secure communication. 


If you're seeking a data analytics and cybersecurity enthusiast with a proven track record, I'm your ideal candidate. Connect with me on LinkedIn  to discuss how my skills and passion can contribute to your team.
